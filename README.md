# Datvil – Child Safety and CSAE Standards

_Last updated: 2025-11-21_

These Child Safety Standards apply to the **Datvil** mobile application (the **"App"**) operated by **Georgii Tselkovskii** (the **"Developer"**). Datvil is an **18+ dating application** and is not intended for children.

Google Play requires Social and Dating apps to maintain clear, public standards regarding **Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)**. This document sets out Datvil’s position and procedures.

## 1. Definition of CSAE

For the purposes of these standards, **Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE)** includes, but is not limited to:

- Any sexual activity involving a person under the age of 18.
- Any sexualized depiction of a minor, including cartoons, drawings, or text-based content.
- Grooming or attempting to groom a minor.
- Sextortion, blackmail, or coercion involving sexual content and a minor.
- Trafficking, advertising, or solicitation of a child for sexual purposes.
- Possession, creation, distribution, or promotion of **Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)** in any form (images, video, audio, text, or other media).

---

## 2. Zero-Tolerance Policy

Datvil maintains a **zero-tolerance policy** for CSAE and CSAM.

The following are strictly prohibited on the App:

- Profiles that indicate or suggest that the user is under 18.
- Attempts by adults to contact, groom, or exploit minors.
- Any content that sexualizes minors or appears to involve minors.
- Any attempt to request, share, trade, or distribute CSAM.
- Any behavior that encourages offline exploitation, trafficking, or abuse of minors.

Users who engage in such conduct will be **immediately suspended or banned**, and relevant content will be removed.

---

## 3. App Intended for Adults (18+)

- Datvil is designed **only for adults aged 18 and older**.
- Users must represent that they are at least 18 years old to use the App.
- If the Developer becomes aware that a user is under 18, the associated account may be suspended or deleted and, where appropriate, related data may be retained only as required for legal or safety reasons.

---

## 4. Detection, Moderation, and Enforcement

The Developer may use a combination of:

- User reports and feedback.
- Manual review of profiles and content.
- Automated or semi-automated checks (where applicable).

to identify content and behavior that may violate these Child Safety Standards.

When CSAE-related concerns are identified:

1. The relevant content may be restricted, hidden, or removed.
2. The user’s account may be suspended or permanently banned.
3. The Developer may restrict access to the App from related devices or accounts.
4. Where appropriate, the Developer may preserve relevant information to comply with legal or reporting obligations.

## 5. Handling of CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material)

If Datvil becomes aware of or receives a credible report that **CSAM** is present on the App or shared via the App:

1. The content will be **immediately removed or disabled**.
2. The associated account(s) will be **suspended or banned**.
3. Relevant information may be **reported to the appropriate authorities or hotlines** in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  
4. The Developer will cooperate with law enforcement and appropriate child protection organizations, as required by law.

Datvil does not tolerate CSAM in any form and will take swift action to address confirmed or credible reports.

## 6. In-App Reporting and User Feedback

Datvil provides a mechanism for users to **report concerns, abusive behavior, or suspicious content**, including potential CSAE, directly from within the App (for example, via a “Report” or “Feedback” option on profiles, chats, or settings).

Users are encouraged to report:

- Any suspicion that a user may be under 18.
- Any sexually explicit or suggestive content that may involve minors.
- Any grooming, coercion, blackmail, or trafficking behavior.
- Any other conduct that appears abusive, dangerous, or illegal.

Reports are reviewed, and appropriate action is taken in line with these standards and relevant laws.

## 7. Compliance with Child Safety Laws

The Developer aims to comply with applicable **child protection and online safety laws and regulations**, which may include obligations to:

- Remove or disable access to illegal content.
- Report confirmed cases of CSAM to relevant authorities or reporting centers, in accordance with local requirements.
- Cooperate with law enforcement and regulatory bodies when required.

Because laws differ by country and region, responses may vary based on the location of the report and the individuals involved.

## 8. Cooperation with Platforms and Authorities

If Datvil is notified by **Google Play** or other platforms about potential CSAE content or behavior:

- The report will be reviewed promptly.
- Appropriate enforcement actions (content removal, account suspension, etc.) will be taken.
